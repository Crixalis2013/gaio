## Introduction

For a typical golang network program, you would first `conn := lis.Accept()` to get a connection and `go func(net.Conn)` to start a goroutine for handling the incoming data, then you would `buf:=make([]byte, 4096)` to allocate some buffer and finally waits on `conn.Read(buf)`. This is wasteful in memory, especially for a server holding >10K connections and most of them are in idle. 

In this case, you need at least **2KB(goroutine stack) + 4KB(buffer)** for receiving data on one connection, at least **6KB x 10K = 60MB** in total, this number will be doubled with data sending goroutine, not counting the **context switches**

```gaio``` is an [proactor pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proactor_pattern) networking library satisfy both **memory requirements** and **performance requirements**.

By eliminating **one goroutine per one connection scheme** with **Edge-Triggered IO Multiplexing**, the 2KB goroutine stack can be saved, and by restricting delivery order or events, internal **mutual buffer** can be shared for all incoming connections in a `Watcher`.

## Guarantees

1. Only a fixed number of goroutines will be created per **Watcher**(the core object of this library).
2. The IO-completion notification on a **Watcher** is sequential, that means buffer can be reused in some pattern.
3. Non-intrusive design, this library works with `net.Listener` and `net.Conn`. (with `syscall.RawConn` support)
4. Support for Linux, BSD.
